# Index of Power BI projects
I did these Power BI projects for companies, which is why I had to blur the images of the dashboards or make mock-up data to preserve the real data.

## Power BI Dashboard for Pipeline Logistics and Operational Monitoring

Power BI dashboard developed to support pipeline logistics operations by integrating data from two distinct systems: a modern Azure Databricks database and a legacy system exporting planning data via poorly formatted Excel files. The dashboard provides key operational indicators such as inventory, inbound/outbound flows, ship loading/unloading, sales, and final stock levels. It includes filters to explore data from a global overview down to specific pipelines, terminals, refineries, or ports. The result is a clean, efficient tool used daily by logistics teams for data-driven decision-making.

## Long-Term Operations Analysis Dashboard
I developed a historical operations dashboard that brings together data on pipeline movements, refinery production and market performance. The project relied on an Azure database containing records dating back to the 1990s, allowing the dashboard to draw long-term trend lines that reveal how each operation has evolved over time. Alongside these visuals, I created a detailed table that breaks down movement values by product and year, with the option to expand the view to month, terminal, movement direction, pipeline segment and operation type. This structure gives users both a broad historical overview and the ability to explore the data at a very granular level.

To complement these visuals, the dashboard also presents a set of general statistics, including historical records, averages, standard deviation and the month in which each record occurred. These indicators help highlight unusual behaviors, performance peaks and long-term patterns that would otherwise be hard to detect. The result is a clear and comprehensive environment that strengthens operational analysis and supports managers in understanding how the system has changed over decades and where opportunities for improvement may lie.


## Interactive Visuals for Logistics Operations Monitoring
I was challenged to transform a raw dataset of market outflow records into an interactive Power BI dashboard that captures the historical movement of three different sales hubs. The idea was to give the company a clear view of how each hub evolves month by month while also allowing a detailed look at the performance of the three products sold across these locations. I organized and modeled the data to create visuals that compare monthly volumes in a stacked format or break them down by product, making it easy to switch between consolidated and detailed analysis.

A key part of the work was building flexible time filters so users can isolate specific portions of each month, such as the first few days, the 10th day, the last ten days or any other custom range. This makes it possible to identify patterns within the historical series and understand how behavior shifts at different points in the month. The final result is a clear, intuitive dashboard that improves visibility over market outflows and supports faster, more informed decision-making.
