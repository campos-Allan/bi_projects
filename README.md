# Index of Power BI projects
I did these Power BI projects for companies, which is why I had to blur the images of the dashboards or make mock-up data to preserve the real data.

## [Identifying and Analyzing Bottlenecks in the Logistics Network with Power BI](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7265710665032454144/)
The objective was to create a visual dashboard that would highlight critical areas of the logistics network, providing management with a detailed and focused view for decision-making. The first task involved accessing and processing a massive spreadsheet containing 40,000 rows of logistical data. Initially overwhelming, the solution was to apply filtering and transformation techniques to efficiently organize the information and segment the relevant data.

Using Power BI, I developed a dynamic, map-style logistics dashboard that highlights bottlenecks and critical points in the network. The dashboard offers a clear view of how flows are occurring and where the main obstacles are located. By clicking on any critical bottleneck on the map, users are directed to a separate page that provides a more detailed analysis, comparing current conditions with the original plan. This helps management identify areas that need adjustments or improvements, improving visibility and control over the logistics operations.

## [Data Transformation into Interactive Visuals for Logistics Operations Monitoring](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7265348332594593795/)
I was challenged to transform a massive operations spreadsheet into a series of interactive visuals in Power BI to optimize inventory tracking, product movements, and the time evolution of operational processes. The goal was to create both a macro and detailed view, allowing the company to make quick and informed decisions about its logistics and operations.

The original spreadsheet contained data on inventory movements, product arrivals, and departures across different operational hubs. I organized this data in Power BI, creating interactive charts to represent the evolution of inventory over time, comparing it with storage limits. Additionally, I created visualizations to clarify the volumes moved at each operational hub, consolidating data by month. A key point of the project was analyzing the average time of movements and how it evolved over time, which helped identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in logistics operations. The impact of this transformation was a direct improvement in operational control, enabling managers to track inventory in real time, analyze movement efficiency, and generate detailed, dynamic reports for specific analyses based on product, period, and location.

## [Power BI Dashboard for Pipeline Logistics and Operational Monitoring](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/allan-camposs_powerbi-dataanalytics-logaedstica-activity-7345457386897207296-QBQw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADtg6uEBHdQXp8y9Wx7XjwrysDAtoVGhFAA)
<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PMXL2yS.png" width="800" /></p>
Power BI dashboard developed to support pipeline logistics operations by integrating data from two distinct systems: a modern Azure Databricks database and a legacy system exporting planning data via poorly formatted Excel files. The dashboard provides key operational indicators such as inventory, inbound/outbound flows, ship loading/unloading, sales, and final stock levels. It includes filters to explore data from a global overview down to specific pipelines, terminals, refineries, or ports. The result is a clean, efficient tool used daily by logistics teams for data-driven decision-making.

## [Interactive Expense Dashboard](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/allan-camposs_datascience-googlesheets-powerbi-activity-7264985870812782593-__W5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADtg6uEBHdQXp8y9Wx7XjwrysDAtoVGhFAA)
The challenge was to replace a manual expense tracking process with an automated and interactive solution that would simplify financial control and decision-making. To address this, an automation system was created in Google Spreadsheet to record and organize the companyâ€™s expenses, along with a feature to automatically highlight upcoming due expenses. Using an interactive menu, those responsible can easily view, mark as paid, and track the status of bills, streamlining the workflow and minimizing the risk of late payments.

Additionally, an interactive dashboard was developed in Power BI to provide real-time insights into the company's financial health. The dashboard displays dynamic charts that track the evolution of expenses over time, show the distribution of spending by category, and compare revenue, profit, and expenses. This detailed view offers the team a solid foundation for more informed financial decisions, identifying areas for optimization and ensuring better control over spending and budgeting. The solution increased efficiency and provided valuable insights for leadership.
